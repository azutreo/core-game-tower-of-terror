	Hello, everyone!

	Simple Spectator Camera is an easy drag-and-drop component that will handle spectator UI, bindings,
	teams, and the entire spectator system for you.

	Editing the component is very easy: there are several custom properties within the root folder.

	For the best experience, make sure the Respawn Mode in Respawn Settings are set to None and the
	Respawn Delay is set to 0.

	If there is a spectator team, then the player will be assigned to that team when they die and based
	on that team will be shown the Spectator Camera or not. If there is no spectator team, then it'll be
	shown any time the player dies and hidden any time they respawn.

	Thank you,
	Nicholas Foreman
